pseudocode  by using while and spiccal function


variable array a= [17,24,4,26,19,30,2,66,40];
var n= 0

while  n is not exced the length of array then do the following

 take a[n] divide it  by 2 using Modulus operator   % 

	if the result equal to zero then [n] is even
	else the [n] in odd
	go back to while
	
	
	function
	var b=0

as long as is equal to the number of the odd numbers in b

c










var numbers = [17, 24, 4, 26, 19, 30, 2, 66, 40];
var evenNumbers = [];
var oddNumbers = [];

function classifyNumbers(arr){

  for(var i=0; i<=arr.length-1; i++){
     if (arr[i] % 2 === 0 ){
        
        evenNumbers.push(arr[i]);
     } else {
       
        oddNumbers.push(arr[i]);
     }
  }
}

classifyNumbers(numbers);

console.log('Even numbers: ' + evenNumbers);
console.log('Odd numbers: ' + oddNumbers);

var b=0

as long as is equal to the number of the odd numbers in b

check if  the value of b[j] is less than min 
then  min = b[j]
print  min
increase j by one
